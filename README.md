## **Python Programs: Dictionary & List Slicing**

### **Overview**
This repository contains two Python programs focusing on data structures and string manipulation:

1. **Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks**  
2. **Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing**  

Each program demonstrates fundamental concepts of Python dictionaries and lists.

## **Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks**  
**Filename:** `Task1.py`  

### **Description**  
This program defines a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values. The user enters a student's name, and the program retrieves and displays the corresponding marks. If the student does not exist, it shows an error message.

### **Usage**  
Run the script and enter a studentâ€™s name when prompted. The program will check and print their marks if found.

### **Example Output**  
```d
Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks: 85
```
### **If the student does not exist in the dictionary:**
```d
Enter the student's name: john
Student not found
```

## **Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing**  
**Filename:** `Task2.py`  

### **Description**  
This program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracts the first five elements, reverses them, and prints both the extracted and reversed lists.

### **Usage**  
Run the script, and it will display the sliced and reversed lists automatically.

### **Example Output**  
```d
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
